### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Early on we figured how to interact with HTML and CSS from the JavaSript file that allowed us to work through the iterations smoothly.
Another win we had was after many hours of searching and trying to figure out how to not have any double covers we finally got it to work.
