### Context:
[//]: <>
The team worked for 25 hours over the course of 5 days on making this website functional. The project was assigned during the second week of Turing in mod1. That said, much of the projects requirements went beyond what was learned in the classroom and took extensive research and collaboration.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals were:
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
- Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
- Write code collaboratively
- Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
- Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
We worked within the JS file. We accessed the provided CSS code and made edits to the HTML code through the JS file. We worked with GitHub for the first time in partners in order to practice pushing and pulling code through the git workflow, and also practiced creating pull requests.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Some wins/challenges and solutions we had during this project:
- Early on we figured how to interact with HTML and CSS from the JavaSript file that allowed us to work through the iterations smoothly.
  - This required team member returning to the lessons for the week to understand how to manipulate the HTML and CSS code through JS.
- Another win we had was after many hours of searching and trying to debug our code so as not to have any double covers in our saved covers section. We finally were able to get it to work by rubber ducking with another team to get another pair of eyes on the code.
